  Brief overview of API

The goal of the Events Building Block is to provide a set of RESTFul web services to manage events in the Rokwire platform. This includes adding a new event, retrieving relevant events based on search query, etc. 


## What is it?

We manage the database of campus-related events in the Rokwire platform. With the database being updated, finding and accessing those events can be made easier with the Illinois app.



## Where should I go next?

Go to the Getting Started page for basic information you need before trying on the API Swagger.
